Beautifully crafted lyre.

## DM Notes

If you examine it or play it, ask for:

- **DC 12 Arcana or Performance**

**Success:**

You sense it can grant a small echo of inspiration once per long rest.

**Failure:**

You only know it is magical and bound to you — its deeper resonance remains unclear.
