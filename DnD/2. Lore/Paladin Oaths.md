# **The Oaths of the Eight**

_An excerpt from the Temple Archives, dated centuries past_

 The paladins of old divided their vows into eight sacred oaths, each a path toward virtue and service.

- **Glory**: To inspire and lead through noble deeds.
- **Devotion**: To act in service to the divine with unwavering faith.
- **Vengeance**: To deliver justice to those who stray from the righteous path.
- **Redemption**: To temper judgment with mercy.
- **Crown**: To serve law and authority with honour.
- **Watchers**: To remain vigilant against threats to the faithful.
- **Conquest**: To claim what is rightfully theirs and protect it.
- **Ancients**: To honour the old ways, and preserve the wisdom of those who came before.
