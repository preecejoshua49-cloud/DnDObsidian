Backstory: "Abidemi was born on a harsh frontier where soldiers stood between civilization and ruin. His name means born in the father’s absence. His father, a commander within The Vanguard, was known for speaking softly to his blade before battle — a habit most soldiers dismissed as a ritual. During a campaign beyond the frontier, his unit vanished without explanation. Officially declared dead, but rumours and unanswered questions lingered long after.\r\rRaised among soldiers, Abidemi grew up believing in discipline and duty. He joined The Vanguard young and spent years fighting man, beast, and otherworldly horrors.\r\rOver time, fear along the frontier changed the army’s methods. Villages suspected of harbouring danger were condemned before proof could be found, and orders became increasingly ruthless.\r\rUnable to accept the slaughter of innocents, Abidemi raised his shield to protect and levelled his spear to the command that gave the order. Fighting broke out, and many people — including former friends — died. Abidemi left carrying guilt and uncertainty about his choice.\r\rAfter abandoning military life, he survived in the borderlands as a mercenary and bounty hunter, choosing contracts that targeted slavers, cult leaders, warlords, and others who abused power. During this time, strange abilities began to appear.\r\rHe discovered within himself an awareness of corruption and unnatural evil that pressed against his senses like rot carried on the wind. And when he laid his hands upon the wounded, warmth answered his will, mending flesh and bone, and purging sickness from those who had already answered Death’s call.\r\rSoon after, the dreams began — visions of a distant plane wrapped in endless dusk, with shadows watching from afar.\r\rAs stories of his actions spread, people began calling him Obasi — one who serves the will of the divine.\rHe has not sworn a formal oath, but he feels himself being drawn toward a path of vengeance — determined to punish the greater evil, even as he struggles with a lingering shadow that seems tied to his bloodline and his fate."
