Backstory: I wasn’t raised in a traditional stone temple. I grew up in the Sanctum of the Silver Orchard, a secluded monastery where the gods speak not in words, but in the "Great Resonance"—the vibration of the world. My duty wasn’t just to pray; it was to keep the orchard alive through song.While other bards busked for coin, I learned the "Litany of the Leaf." A certain frequency could make sickly roots sprout Goodberries, and choral harmonies could shield my fellow monks in divine light. I was gifted a lute carved from a fallen silver-bark tree, my holy symbol and instrument.Then the Orchard began to fade. The "Resonance" grew quiet, and we realized the world outside was falling into discord. I was chosen as the "Vocalist of the Vigil," sent out to find the source of this silence. I don’t just play music; I try to retune the world, one battle at a time.
