**Chapter Opening:**
The ninth pillar detonates in a surge of dark radiant force.
Light fractures into shadow.
The sacred chamber trembles as cracks split across the stone floor.
The air grows heavy — suffocating — thick with divine energy twisted into something hollow.
The remaining oath symbols burn black.
When the dust settles…
He is still standing.
“Before we begin… do you mean to ask anything?”
