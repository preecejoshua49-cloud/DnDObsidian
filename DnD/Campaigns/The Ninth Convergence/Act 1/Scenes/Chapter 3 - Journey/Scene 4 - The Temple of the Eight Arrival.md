### 🎭 Read Aloud

> The forest thins as the caravan crests a gentle ridge.  
> Beyond the trees, the **Temple of the Eight** rises in full view.
> 
> An impressive structure of pale stone, perfectly symmetrical. Its spires reach skyward like fingers of devotion, catching the late afternoon sun. The massive doors stand open, welcoming travelers.
> 
> Bright banners, each representing one of the eight oaths, ripple gently in the breeze.  
> The courtyard is tidy, immaculate — no signs of fire, chaos, or neglect.
> 
> Horses step carefully down the slope, nostrils flaring at new scents: stone, incense, and something faintly metallic in the air.  
> The novices glance toward the temple with quiet awe, silence holding them in check.

Pause to let the players take in the sight.

## 🧠 DM Notes – Atmosphere

- This is a **moment of awe and calm**, but subtly foreshadows tension.
    
- Players can notice small details if they investigate:
    
    - Slight scratches in the stone near the gate.
        
    - Faint scorch marks from distant fires.
        
    - Smell of incense slightly mixed with iron.
        
- Horses remain on edge — the natural world senses residual tension from the Temple Road.
