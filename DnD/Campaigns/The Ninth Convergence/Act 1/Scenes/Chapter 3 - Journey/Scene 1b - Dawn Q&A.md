**1. Party:** “How long until we reach the Temple?”  
**Master:** “If the road holds, a full day from dawn. That assumes no surprises. Hills, rivers, and the occasional wildlife hazard will slow us. And… trouble seems more common than usual.”

**2. Party:** “Have you noticed anything unusual on this route?”  
**Master:** “Subtle things. A shrine defaced here, a knight wandering alone there. Nothing I could put a price on… but enough to make a merchant uneasy. Paladins speak of small disturbances. Keep your eyes open.”

**3. Party:** “Why is the temple sending a caravan so early?”  
**Master:** “Orders from above. Nothing more complicated than that. But… when the temple sends a supply convoy at sunrise instead of midday, it’s because someone expects trouble.”

**4. Party:** “What’s with the novices?”  
**Master:** “Quiet, observant, and a little on edge. They’ve been riding since dawn with little sleep. Don’t underestimate them. Young, yes, but sharp. And scared. If they weren’t, I’d worry.”

**5. Party:** “Ever had trouble along this road before?”  
**Master:** “Bandits, wolves, bad weather. Nothing out of the ordinary… except lately, the tension in the forest feels heavier. You feel it? That chill in the wind that isn’t from snow?”

**6. Party:** “Do you trust these guards?”  
**Master:** “They follow orders. Some better than others."

**7. Party:** “Is the temple under threat?”  
**Master:** “That’s not my concern. Mine is getting the wagons there in one piece. But… the signs aren’t good. I’ve seen frightened men pray too hard to quiet their own fear.”

**8. Party:** “Why the symbol on the lead wagon?”  
**Master:** “It identifies us to the temple. It’s a warning: this is official. No funny business with merchants or locals. And perhaps… it reminds us that the road is watched.”

**9. Party:** “What should we do if we see trouble?”  
**Master:** “Stay calm. Observe. Only act if necessary. I’ve escorted enough to know rash action can turn a scuffle into a funeral. Oh, And… trust your instincts.”
