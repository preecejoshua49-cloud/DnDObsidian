| **“Who are you?”**                                | Deryn Calder (Devotion): “I am the anchor of this Temple. The others uphold the Oaths as you see them.”  <br>Valen (Vengeance): “I am the hand that enforces retribution where balance fails.”  <br>Selara (Protection): “I shield those within these walls.”  <br>Kaelen (Justice): “I measure fairness and truth.”  <br>Tharis (Conquest): “I take what must be taken.”  <br>Lyra (Redemption): “I mend what can be restored.”  <br>Ryn (Zeal): “I burn for the righteous cause.”  <br>Cael (Watchful): “I see what others overlook.” | Short, formal, slightly intimidating. Avoids personal warmth.  |
| **“Is there anything we can help with?”**         | All avatars: initially cold or dismissive.  <br>Deryn: “We require no aid from strangers. The Temple endures without it.”  <br>Other avatars may echo: “This is not your concern.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Subtle challenge — sets the bar for proving worth.             |
| **“Why are you gathered?”**                       | Deryn: “Our deliberations are not for casual ears.”  <br>Kaelen: “Justice cannot be rushed by outsiders.”  <br>Lyra: “Some matters require patience, not meddling.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Hint that something important is underway, but no details yet. |
| **“Is anyone in danger?”**                        | Selara: “Within the Temple? No. Beyond its walls, that is for others to see.”  <br>Ryn: “The faithful must hold their posts. You are not among them… yet.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Foreshadow potential threats outside.                          |
| **“Do you need us?”**                             | All avatars initially: “No.”  <br>Deryn: “Your skills are untested here, and this is no place for random interference.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Establishes tension. Party feels unwelcome.                    |
| **Mention Obasi’s letter / “Sir Obasi sent us.”** | Deryn’s tone shifts subtly:  <br>“Then you walk a path recognized. He speaks with authority. I will call for him and we will talk.”  <br>Other avatars: nods, slight relaxation, subtle acknowledgment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | The only “softening” point. Party earns audience legitimacy.   |
