| **“Why are we here?”**                          | “You have been summoned because the Oaths themselves are threatened. Your presence is required to ensure balance is maintained. Obasi has requested you for this purpose — your judgment and actions matter.”                                                                    | Establishes authority and legitimacy, frames stakes, and connects party to Obasi.          |
| **“What exactly do we need to do?”**            | “Travel to **Thalrin’s Hollow**, there is a ritual site near a village by the forest clearing where the ritual must be performed. You are to accompany the Devotion paladin and Obasi. Observe carefully. Intervene only where necessary. Ensure Obasi reaches the site safely.” | Clear mission, but purpose is deliberately formal and distant; leaves room for encounters. |
| **“Who is the Devotion paladin there?”**        | “A stalwart of the Oath, whose presence guarantees the ritual proceeds correctly. You will meet him upon arrival. Treat him with respect, and follow his guidance without question.”                                                                                             | This is secretly Deryn — the party doesn’t know yet. DM can plan the reveal later.         |
| **“Why does Obasi need to be there?”**          | “His oath lends strength to the ceremony. Without it, the ritual cannot complete properly. You are to bring him safely and ensure his participation.”                                                                                                                            | Reinforces urgency; the party sees Obasi as essential.                                     |
| **“What happens if we fail?”**                  | “Failure is not an option. Consequences ripple beyond Thalrin’s Hollow. The Oaths themselves may falter, and the balance you are sworn to protect could be lost.”                                                                                                                | High stakes, vague enough to preserve tension and mystery.                                 |
| **“Are there dangers along the way?”**          | “The path is unpredictable. You may encounter corruption, natural hazards, or adversaries who would see the Oaths broken. Vigilance and discernment are your best tools.”                                                                                                        | Gives DM flexibility for encounters and environmental hazards.                             |
| **“Do we need to prepare anything?”**           | “Bring what you must — supplies, skill, focus, courage. Only readiness of mind and oath will serve you. No tool, spell, or weapon can replace judgment.”                                                                                                                         | Encourages roleplay and planning without granting mechanical advantage.                    |
| **“Can we help with the ritual itself?”**       | “The ritual is not for untested hands. You are to support Obasi and the Devotion paladin. Intervene only as directed. Observation and readiness are your duties first and foremost.”                                                                                             | Maintains control of the ritual’s outcome; party is active but constrained.                |
| **“Why are we trusted with this?”**             | “Because Obasi deemed your skills and judgment sufficient to preserve the balance. That trust is conditional. Overstep, and the consequences will be yours alone.”                                                                                                               | Sets tension and responsibility.                                                           |
| **“Is anyone else at risk at the site?”**       | “Other Oath-bound individuals may be present, but your focus is the ritual, its participants, and maintaining balance. Protect what is essential. Do not intervene beyond your orders.”                                                                                          | Reiterates boundaries and stakes.                                                          |
| **“How will we know if something goes wrong?”** | “Disturbances will reveal themselves — symbols corrupted, rituals faltering, the unexpected in plain sight. Your judgment will be tested. Intervene only when it is clear the Oaths themselves are imperiled.”                                                                   | Prepares party for subtle cues and moral dilemmas.                                         |
| **“When do we leave?”**                         | “At first light. Delay risks failure. The ritual will not wait, and the balance will not endure without timely action.”                                                                                                                                                          | Creates urgency and structure for travel.                                                  |

## 🎭 DM Notes

1. **Tone / Delivery:**
    
    - **Authoritative, calm, intimidating.** Every sentence measured and weighted.
        
    - Uses language emphasizing responsibility, judgment, and conditional trust.
        
    - Avoids revealing his own secret role as the Devotion paladin at the site.
        
2. **Environmental / Narrative Cues:**
    
    - Cold drafts, flickering light, or faint shadows in the chamber hint at subtle corruption.
        
    - Subtle tension between Deryn and Obasi can be hinted at via glances and posture.
        
    - The ritual site at Thalrin’s Hollow should feel remote, sacred, and tense.
        
3. **Foreshadowing:**
    
    - “Balance of the Oaths” and “corruption” repeated in phrasing.
        
    - Emphasizes the weight of moral judgment and potential consequences.
        
    - Obasi’s presence legitimizes party action, building trust but tension remains.
        
4. **Player Agency:**
    
    - Party can ask freely; Deryn responds fully but always formally and vaguely.
        
    - DM can seed encounters, environmental hazards, or moral choices along the journey.
