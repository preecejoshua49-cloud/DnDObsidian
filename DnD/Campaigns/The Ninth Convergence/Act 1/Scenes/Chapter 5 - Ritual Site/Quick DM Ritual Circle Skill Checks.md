### **1. Arcana – Understanding the Pillars**

- **DC 8:** You can identify that each pillar corresponds to a specific paladin oath.
    
- **DC 10:** You sense a faint magical energy linking the pillars together and the ninth central pillar.
    
- **DC 18:** You detect an unusual fluctuation in the ninth pillar — as if it’s drawing energy from the others in a way that feels… slightly unnatural.

### **2. Insight – Reading the Ritual**

- **DC 12:** You notice the novices are fully absorbed in their chants and cannot be disturbed.
    
- **DC 15:** You sense a subtle tension around the unoccupied pillars — almost as if the empty pillars are waiting for something.
    
- **DC 18:** You detect that the central Devotion paladin seems unusually focused on the party and Obasi, with an intensity that goes beyond ordinary guidance.

### **3. Perception – Observing the Circle**

- **DC 12:** You see faint silver light pulsing along the edges of the pillars with each oath chanted.
    
- **DC 15:** You notice the runes on the ninth pillar react slightly to the voices of the novices.
    
- **DC 18:** You glimpse a subtle distortion in the air around the ninth pillar — almost like energy is flowing back toward it instead of outward.

### **4. Religion – Ritual Knowledge**

- **DC 12:** You recognize this as a formal paladin oath ritual designed to reinforce faith and magical power.
    
- **DC 15:** You know the ninth pillar is meant to unify the oaths into one collective blessing.
    
- **DC 18:** You realize that something about the energy flow could _corrupt_ the ritual if the wrong participant steps in — though you can’t be sure what.

### **5. Constitution – Resisting Subtle Effects**

- **DC 12:** You feel a slight pull at your mind as the ritual energy flows — nothing dangerous yet.
    
- **DC 15:** The pull is stronger near the unoccupied pillars; you sense a subtle compulsion to participate.
    
- **DC 18:** You sense the energy tugging at Obasi and perhaps at the party, hinting at something more sinister brewing.
