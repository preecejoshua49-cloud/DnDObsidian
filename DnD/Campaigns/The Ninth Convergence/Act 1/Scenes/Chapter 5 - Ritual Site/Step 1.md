### 🎭 Read Aloud

> The clearing is unnaturally still.  
> Nine stone pillars form a circle  — each etched with the sigil of an Oath, but one is unmarked.
> The air feels heavy, like a held breath.
> 
> The Devotion paladin stands at the Devotion pillar, posture flawless, armor gleaming softly in the fading light.
> 
> He turns toward Obasi. His gaze is calm. Measured. Commanding.
> 
> “Step forward,” he says.  
> “Place your hands on the stone. Let the ritual guide your devotion.”

Pause.

Let the party react if they wish.

## 🛡 Obasi Kneels

### DM Direction

Obasi steps forward without hesitation.

He moves to the **Vengeance pillar**.

He kneels.

His hand rests against the carved rune.

### 🎲 Optional: Wisdom Saving Throw (DC 14)

**This represents the ritual’s subtle corruption beginning to reach him.**

- **Success:**  
    He feels something pulling at the edges of his thoughts.  
    A pressure behind the eyes.  
    A whisper that is not his own.  
    He tightens his jaw — resisting.
    
- **Failure:**  
    He kneels without resistance.  
    Calm. Focused.  
    But inside, something hooks into him.

### 🎭 Read Aloud (Either Result)

> Obasi lowers himself before the pillar, hand resting lightly on the carved rune.
> 
> A soft silver glow pulses beneath his palm.
> 
> He breathes deeply, steady and composed, preparing to speak his oath.
> 
> For a moment… it feels sacred. Blessed.  
> As though this truly is a ceremony of restoration.

# 🎲 Party During This Moment

Let the players choose:

- Do they spread out?
    
- Do they watch carefully?
    
- Do they stand near Obasi?
    
- Do they trust the Devotion paladin?
    

If anyone examines the ritual:

### Perception (DC 13)

- The glow pulses slightly out of sync with Obasi’s breathing.
    

### Arcana / Religion (DC 14)

- The ritual circle is structured correctly…
    
- But the flow of energy feels inverted.
    
- Like something is drawing inward instead of harmonizing outward.

# 🎭 The Devotion Paladin Speaks

### Read Aloud

> “By the Eight who bind us…”
> 
> The pillars respond.
> 
> One by one, faint light stirs in the carved sigils.
> 
> “Let the fractured be mended.”
> 
> The wind shifts.
> 
> “Let devotion anchor us.”

# 🌬 Environmental Escalation

Start subtle. Build slowly.

- Wind begins circling inward.
    
- Leaves lift from the ground.
    
- The temperature drops.
    
- The ground hums faintly.
    

If players react:

- The Devotion paladin does not break focus.
    
- His voice remains perfectly steady.

# 🎭 If the Party Questions the Ritual Mid-Ceremony

**“Is this normal?”**

Devotion Paladin:

> “All sacred acts feel unfamiliar to the uninitiated. Hold your ground.”

**“Something feels wrong.”**

> “Faith often does — before it strengthens.”

**If they attempt to interrupt early:**

The energy flares violently for a moment.

> “Stand down,” he says sharply — the first crack in his calm.

# 🧠 DM Notes – Subtle Corruption Indicators

This is where you layer in unease without revealing the twist.

- The glow under Obasi shifts from silver → faint blue → almost imperceptible gold flicker.
    
- The Devotion pillar’s light burns slightly warmer than the others.
    
- The air carries a faint metallic tang.
    
- The wind always blows toward the Devotion paladin, never away.
    

Let them notice things — but not enough to be certain.
