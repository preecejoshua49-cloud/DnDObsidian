## The New Rune

Across the face of the ninth pillar, a new symbol etches itself into the stone.

Describe it slowly.

> An incomplete, fractured circle.
> 
> Asymmetrical.
> 
> Uneven.
> 
> From its centre, eight jagged lines split inward — not straight, but broken.

## 📖 If the Party Has the Book of Oaths

Prompt them:

> The book gets cold.
> 
> The book violently opens to a new page
> 
> A passage reveals itself that was not visible before.

Allow the holder to read.

Pause.

Let them react.

## 🎭 Read Aloud

>One by one, the novices begin speaking.
>Their voices are calm.

---

> “By my will, I abandon Glory — I seek no light beyond my own.”

The Glory symbol on the ninth pillar shatters.

Its light dims to embers.

---

> “By my will, I forsake the Ancients — I sever the old roots that bind me.”

Another symbol fractures.

A crack runs through the pillar.

---

“By my will, I renounce Redemption — mercy is weakness I cast aside.” 
“By my will, I turn from the Crown — I kneel to no throne.” 
“By my will, I turn from the Watchers — I guard nothing but my own power.” 
“By my will, I abandon Conquest — I claim dominion without restraint.”

Now only two remain.

Devotion.

Vengeance.

Burning side by side.

# Obasi’s Moment

If Obasi failed earlier:

He feels no hesitation.

The Vengeance rune pulses in sync with the fractured circle.

If he succeeded:

Heat builds at his pillar.

Pressure pushes back.

The air in front of him warps.

Resistance.

Visible.

The Vengeance symbol trembles — but does not yield.

Pause.


---

# The Turn

Devotion finally looks toward the party.

“Even justice… can be bent.”

Then, calmly:

“By my will, I abandon Vengeance — justice bends to my desire.”

The Vengeance symbol does not dim gently.

It violently shatters.

A shockwave slams outward.

Players (Strength save DC 15 to remain standing).

The fractured circle flares brighter.

Only Devotion remains.

---

# The Final Severance

Devotion turns back to the pillar.

Places both hands upon it.

Then he speaks.

---

> “By my will, I break **Devotion**.
> 
> I cast aside **Vengeance**.
> 
> I kneel to no **Glory**, nor bend to the **Ancients**.
> 
> I answer not **Redemption**, nor do I yield to **Crown**.
> 
> I guard nothing, heed no **Watchers**, and claim no **Conquest**.
> 
> I bind myself to no creed, no divine will.
> 
> I claim the power that remains when faith is stripped bare.”

At this point—

Have the Book holder continue reading.

>“I am Deryn Calder, Oathbreaker.”
