“You arrive at a peaceful clearing, sunlight filtering softly through the treetops. Nine ancient pillars rise in a perfect circle, etched with runes that hum faintly in the morning air. Six of the pillars are already occupied by kneeling novice paladins, their hands resting lightly on the stone, voices soft and melodic as they chant their oaths.

In the centre of the circle stands a single figure, his armour gleaming in the sunlight. He is waiting, poised and calm, clearly expecting you. His presence commands respect, and there is a serene authority in his stance. From the way he holds himself, it is clear he is strong in his oath, ready to guide those who join the ritual.

Two pillars remain unoccupied: Vengeance and Devotion.
