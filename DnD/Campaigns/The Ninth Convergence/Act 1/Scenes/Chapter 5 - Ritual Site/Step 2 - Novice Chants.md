## 🧠 What the Party Notices

### Passive Perception 12+

The light flows _toward_ the ninth pillar… not evenly between all eight.

### Arcana / Religion DC 14

The structure is correct.

But the flow of power feels centralized.

Contained.

Focused.

### Insight DC 13 (on Devotion paladin)

His expression is serene.

Too serene.

---

## 🎭 Devotion & Vengeance

Now the final two.

Let this breathe.

Slow your pacing.

---

> The Devotion paladin speaks next.
> 
> “By Devotion, I uphold the light.”
> 
> His pillar flares — warm gold.
> 
> The glow is stronger than the others.
> 
> Then Obasi speaks.
> 
> “By Vengeance, I deliver justice.”
> 
> The Vengeance rune on the ninth pillar ignites.
> 
> Bright.
> 
> Brilliant.
> 
> The energy pulses outward in response.

The entire circle now hums in harmonic resonance.

Silver light threads through all pillars.

For a moment…

It feels whole.

Sacred.

Perfect.

## 🌬 Subtle Shift

This is where you seed tension.

- The silver light flickers faintly blue at the edges.
    
- The wind stops abruptly — unnatural stillness.
    
- The ninth pillar pulses once… slightly out of rhythm.
    

If anyone is watching Obasi:

### Insight DC 14

His jaw tightens briefly.  
A flicker of strain crosses his face.

If anyone watches Devotion:

### Insight DC 15

He is not strained at all.

He looks… satisfied.

## 🔔 Pause for Player Interaction

This is your intervention window.

Let them:

- Move positions
    
- Speak up
    
- Examine the ninth pillar
    
- Try to disrupt something
    
- Question the Devotion paladin

## 🎭 If Players Ask “Is This Normal?”

Devotion Paladin:

> “Balance requires alignment. Do not break the harmony now.”

If they move toward Obasi:

> “Hold your place. The oath binds stronger through stillness.”

If someone touches a pillar:

The energy stings like static.

Not harmful yet.

But charged.

## 🧠 DM Escalation Notes

You now have three branching speeds:

### Slow Burn

Let the harmony build another round.

### Moderate Tension

The ninth pillar pulses harder.  
Silver begins tinting blue.

### Immediate Turn

The silver threads suddenly snap inward.
