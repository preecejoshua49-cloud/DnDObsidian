**Opening Description:** The village lies quiet as you wander through its narrow, cobbled streets. Smoke curls from chimneys and the distant murmur of voices drifts from a building at the square — a tavern, its door swinging in the breeze. Hunger and fatigue press upon you, and the warm glow from within promises food, drink, and perhaps a place to rest.

Inside, the air is thick with ale and smoke. A lone dwarf slouches at a table, surrounded by emptied tankards, murmuring to himself. Your presence does not go unnoticed as you feel eyes watch your every move.
