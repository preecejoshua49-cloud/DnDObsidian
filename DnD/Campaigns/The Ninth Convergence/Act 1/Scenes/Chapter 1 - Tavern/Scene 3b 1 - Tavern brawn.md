## ⚔ Combat Adjustments (Important for Balance)

If party is drunk:

Choose ONE of these:

- Reduce mercenary HP by 2–3 each
    
- Make one mercenary drunk and reckless
    
- Have mercenaries flee at half HP
    
- Guards arrive after 3 rounds
    

This prevents accidental TPK at Level 1.

## 🎲 Optional Drunken Chaos (Light Touch Only)

At the start of each drunk PC’s turn, roll 1d6:

1. You stumble and fall prone.
    
2. Overcommit — first attack has advantage, but attacks against you have advantage until next turn.
    
3. You loudly insult someone irrelevant.
    
4. You mistake a table for cover (no effect).
    
5. Sudden clarity — ignore drunk penalties this turn.
    
6. Liquid courage — gain 2 temp HP.
    

Use sparingly — once per round total is usually enough.
