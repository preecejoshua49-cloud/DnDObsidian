## 🏚 If the Party Returns to the Tavern

### 🎭 Read Aloud

> The tavern door opens only a crack.
> 
> The innkeeper peers out, face flat. Unimpressed.
> 
> “No rooms. No cots. Find another roof.”
> 
> The door shuts.

No negotiation.

Pause for player reaction.

## 🧠 DM Notes

- This is consequence, not punishment.
    
- Do not allow persuasion rolls unless you want to soften tone.
    
- If they attempt force — escalate carefully (guards, reputation damage).
    
- The tavern is closed to them for now.
    

This reinforces that actions have weight.

# 🐴 The Stable

## 🎭 Read Aloud (Arrival)

> A short walk down the road stands a modest stable beside a fenced paddock.
> 
> Lanternlight glows low against rough timber beams.
> 
> An older stablehand sits on a crate near the entrance, chewing slowly on a piece of straw.
> 
> He squints at you.
> 
> “You with the caravan?”

Pause.

## If They Say Yes

### 🎭 Read Aloud

> He nods once.
> 
> “Empty stalls in the back. Hay’s dry. Don’t spook the horses.”
> 
> He jerks his thumb toward the interior.

No further questions.

## If They Say No

He shrugs.

> “Then coin talks.”

Charge a few silver pieces for space in the hay.

# 🐎 Inside the Stable

### 🎭 Read Aloud

> Warmth hits you first — animal heat trapped beneath wooden beams.
> 
> The air smells of hay, leather, and earth.
> 
> Horses shift quietly in their stalls. Slow breathing. Occasional hoof against wood.
> 
> Lanternlight flickers across beams and tack hooks.
> 
> It isn’t comfortable.
> 
> But it’s shelter.

Pause.

Let them settle.

# 🌬 Night Atmosphere

When the party begins resting:

### 🎭 Read Aloud

> As you settle into the hay, the wind carries a faint chill from the direction of the Temple Road.
> 
> Somewhere far off…
> 
> Metal strikes metal.


Let that sit.

Do not explain it.

# 🧠 DM Intent

The metal sound can mean:

- A distant forge.
    
- A caravan guard drilling.
    
- Something unnatural.
    
- A staged omen.
    

You do not need to define it yet.

Mystery > explanation.
