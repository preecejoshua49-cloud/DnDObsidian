## 🎭 Read Aloud (Arrival)

> Not far from the eastern gate, lanternlight flickers around a wagon drawn slightly off the road.
> 
> A lean, sharp-eyed merchant rearranges crates with obsessive precision. He looks up the moment he notices you.
> 
> “Ah! Travelers!” he calls. “Come, come — gather round! I outfit caravans and adventurers like yourselves. You are adventurers, aren’t you? Gods, anyone can be an adventurer these days…”
> 
> He gestures dramatically to the wagon.
> 
> “Rations, rope, blades, lamp oil — the things you only realize you need when it’s too late. Or when it’s already gone. Happens all the time. Happens to everyone.”
> 
> He leans closer, lowering his voice.
> 
> “And I keep a few… curiosities. Little things that whisper, if you listen carefully. Careful now — some things speak louder than you think.”
> 
> He straightens abruptly and claps once, startling birds from a nearby tree.
> 
> “Names don’t matter! Only supplies. Yes — supplies matter. What is it you need?”

# 🧠 DM Notes – Who Is He?

You can play this three ways:

### 1️⃣ Harmless Eccentric

Just a strange but worldly trader.

### 2️⃣ Information Broker

He subtly gathers intelligence on travellers.

### 3️⃣ Something More

He appears in multiple towns, never aging, never quite explained.

Do not confirm which is true yet.
