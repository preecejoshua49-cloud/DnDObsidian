## 🎭 Read-Aloud Dialogue – Deryn & Obasi

### Deryn Calder – Opening

> Deryn Calder steps forward, eyes scanning the party with measured precision.  
> His voice is calm, deliberate, carrying authority:
> 
> “You have been brought here because your actions, guided by Obasi, intersect with matters of great importance. The balance of the Oaths is at stake — disturbances have arisen, and you are to observe, and if necessary, act.”
> 
> He pauses, letting the weight of his words settle.  
> “Do not presume to interfere beyond what is required. This Temple endures because the Oaths are upheld — by us, and by those who follow their guidance faithfully.”

### Obasi – Clarifying the Party’s Role

> Obasi steps closer, his presence commanding but measured.  
> “The party has been sent at my request. You are not here as mere witnesses. Your skills, judgment, and courage are required to maintain what is at risk outside these walls.”
> 
> He looks at each of the avatars briefly, then back at the party:  
> “There are threats to the Oaths, and evidence that corruption festers where it should not. Your purpose is to follow the guidance of this council, learn what you can, and act where it is necessary — for the good of all who uphold the Oaths.”

### Deryn Calder – Subtle Warning

> Deryn inclines his head slightly.  
> “Consider this a warning: your actions will be observed, your choices weighed. Overreach, and the consequences will be yours to bear. Obedience is not enough — discernment is required. Understand what is at stake.”
