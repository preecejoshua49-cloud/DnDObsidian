### 🎭 Read Aloud (Initial Discovery)

> The caravan slows as you round a bend.
> 
> Smoke curls above the treeline — thin at first, then rising in thick black streaks.
> 
> As you approach, the source becomes horrifyingly clear.
> 
> A supply wagon lies shattered in the road. Wheels splintered. Canvas scorched. Crates overturned and burning at the edges.
> 
> The smell of smoke and iron hangs heavy in the air.

Pause.

Let them step closer.

## 🎭 Read Aloud (The Bodies)

> Bodies lie scattered around the wreckage.
> 
> Guards. Paladins.
> 
> Most are unmoving.
> 
> Each clutches something tightly in their hands — jagged shards of metal, broken pieces of oath-symbols once worn proudly.
> 
> Blood seeps from their palms, as if even in death they refuse to release the fragments.

Pause.

Let players investigate.

## 🧠 DM Truth (For You Only)

- The paladins fractured their oath symbols during a crisis of faith.
    
- The act broke something metaphysical.
    
- The fragments now exert a corrupting pull.
    
- They turned on the caravan in fanatic clarity — believing themselves “freed.”
    

Do not explain this outright.

# 🧍 The Surviving Driver

### 🎭 Read Aloud

> One figure still moves.
> 
> A wiry older wagon driver, soot-streaked and bruised, props himself against the broken wagon.
> 
> His eyes widen when he sees you.

Pause for interaction.

If approached:

> “It… it happened so fast…”
> 
> He coughs.
> 
> “We thought nothing of them. They were paladins…”
> 
> His voice shakes.
> 
> “But they turned. Against us.”

He knows little beyond that.

# 🛡 The Last Paladin

### 🎭 Read Aloud

> Near the wagon lies another figure.
> 
> A paladin.
> 
> His armour is scorched and dented. Every breath rattles painfully in his chest.
> 
> One trembling hand reaches toward the dirt beside him.
> 
> Toward shattered fragments of his oath symbol.
> 
> His fingers twitch, desperate — but too weak to grasp them.

Pause.

Let players decide.

## If the Party Speaks to Him

### 🎭

> His eyes flicker open.
> 
> Pain. Hunger. Something hollow.
> 
> “Please…”
> 
> He coughs, blood staining his lips.
> 
> “I need it. I cannot die without it.”
