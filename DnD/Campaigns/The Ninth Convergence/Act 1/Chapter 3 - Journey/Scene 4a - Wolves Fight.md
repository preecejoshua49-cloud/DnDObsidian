## 🐺 Combat Setup

- **Enemies:** Wolves (or Dire Wolves if you want a slightly higher CR)
    
- **Number:** 3–4 standard wolves, scaling with party size
    
- **Environmental Hazards:**
    
    - Narrow path limits movement
        
    - Wagons block some lines of sight
        
    - Panic checks for horses (DC 12 Wisdom Animal Handling)

## 🧠 DM Notes

- Wolves are intelligent hunters but not supernatural.
    
- Use the horses’ reactions to heighten tension — panicked horses can jostle players or wagons.
    
- Encourage cinematic positioning: players can protect wagons, calm horses, or create chokepoints.
    
- If the party is drunk or exhausted, give disadvantage on perception or Animal Handling.
