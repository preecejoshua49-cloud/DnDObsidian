## 🎭 Read Aloud (Arrival)

Not far from the eastern gate, you are drawn to a man who seems to be talking to himself.
A lean, sharp-eyed merchant rearranges crates with obsessive precision. He looks up the moment he notices you.
“Ah! Travelers!” he calls. “Come, come — gather round! I outfit caravans and adventurers like yourselves. You are adventurers, aren’t you? Gods, anyone can be an adventurer these days…”
He gestures dramatically to the wagon.

“Rations, rope, blades, lamp oil — the things you only realize you need when it’s too late. Or when it’s already gone. Happens all the time. Happens to everyone.”
He leans closer.

“And I keep a few… curiosities. Little things that whisper, if you listen carefully. Careful now — some things speak louder than you think.”
He straightens abruptly and claps once, startling birds from a nearby tree.

Pause to interrupt player
"Where are my manners! What is your name friend?"
He stares with an outreached hand

Pause to interrupt player
“Names don’t matter! Only supplies. Yes — supplies matter. What is it you need?”

Pause for player interaction.
