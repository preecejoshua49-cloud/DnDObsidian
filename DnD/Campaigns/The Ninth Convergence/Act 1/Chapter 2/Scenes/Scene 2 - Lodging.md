## 🏚 If the Party Returns to the Tavern

## 🎭 Read Aloud

The tavern door opens only a crack.
The innkeeper peers out, face flat. Unimpressed.
“No rooms. No cots. Find another roof.”
The door shuts.

No negotiation.

Pause for player reaction.

# 🐴 The Stable

## 🎭 Read Aloud (Arrival)

A short walk down the road stands a modest stable beside a fenced paddock.
Lanternlight glows low against rough timber beams.
An older stable hand sits on a crate near the entrance, chewing slowly on a piece of straw.
He squints at you.
“You with the caravan?”

Pause.

## If They Say Yes

He nods once.
“Empty stalls in the back. Hay’s dry. Don’t spook the horses.”
 He jerks his thumb toward the interior.

No further questions.

## If They Say No

He shrugs.

"Then coin talks.”

Charge a few silver pieces for space in the hay.

# 🐎 Inside the Stable

### 🎭 Read Aloud

Warmth hits you first — animal heat trapped beneath wooden beams.
The air smells of hay, leather, and earth.
Horses shift quietly in their stalls. Slow breathing. Occasional hoof against wood.
Lanternlight flickers across beams and tack hooks.
It isn’t comfortable.
But it’s shelter.

Let them settle.
