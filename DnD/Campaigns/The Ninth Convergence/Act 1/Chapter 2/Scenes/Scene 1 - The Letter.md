## 🎭 - Read Aloud

The tavern door slams shut behind you.  
Laughter and muttering are cut off instantly by thick oak and iron bands.

Standing a few paces from the entrance are two figures who clearly do not belong to the tavern’s atmosphere.
One is a knight in worn but carefully polished armour. The other, a younger squire, holds a sealed parchment in both hands.
The squire steps forward first — hesitant, but steady.

“Forgive the timing,” he says. “We were instructed to wait until you were… available.”

He extends the parchment toward you.


# 📜 The Letter (Handout Text)

Send letter to a player who takes the parchment and ask to read out.
Pause.

## 🎭 Read Aloud (After the Letter)

 As you finish reading, the squire clears his throat.
 “There is a supply caravan leaving at first light. Eastern gate. It travels the Temple Road directly.”
 
 He glances toward the knight, who gives a single nod.
 “They won’t advertise for guards,” the squire continues, “but they won’t turn down armed company either. It is the safest route if you mean to answer Sir Obasi’s summons.”

 The knight finally speaks, voice calm and measured.
 “Be there before sunrise. The caravan master does not linger for stragglers.”

Opportunity does not wait forever.”

They leave.  
You can reintroduce the hook later at higher stakes.

This keeps urgency without railroading.
