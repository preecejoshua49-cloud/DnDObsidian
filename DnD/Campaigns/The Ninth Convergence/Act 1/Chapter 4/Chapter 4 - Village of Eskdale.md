**Chapter Title:**
**Chapter Opening:** 
The road dips into a shallow valley where a small village rests beneath a wooded ridge. Stone cottages, shuttered windows, thin smoke rising from chimneys. At first glance, it looks ordinary.
Then a gust of wind tears down from the ridge.
It’s unnaturally cold.
Your breath fogs. Cloaks snap sharply. The chill cuts deeper than it should — not winter’s cold, but something that feels like warmth being pulled away.
In the village, people pause when it hits. A woman grips her firewood tighter. A farmer steadies himself against a fence.
No one looks surprised.
The wind dies as suddenly as it came.
