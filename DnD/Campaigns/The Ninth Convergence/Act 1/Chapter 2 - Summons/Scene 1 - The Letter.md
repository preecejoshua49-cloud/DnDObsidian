## Read Aloud (Arrival)

> The tavern door slams shut behind you.  
> Laughter and muttering are cut off instantly by thick oak and iron bands.
> 
> Standing a few paces from the entrance are two figures who clearly do not belong to the tavern’s atmosphere.
> 
> One is a knight in worn but carefully polished armour. The other, a younger squire, holds a sealed parchment in both hands.
> 
> The squire steps forward first — hesitant, but steady.
> 
> “Forgive the timing,” he says. “We were instructed to wait until you were… available.”
> 
> He extends the parchment toward you.

## 🎭 Read Aloud (After the Letter)

> As you finish reading, the squire clears his throat.
> 
> “There is a supply caravan leaving at first light. Eastern gate. It travels the Temple Road directly.”
> 
> He glances toward the knight, who gives a single nod.
> 
> “They won’t advertise for guards,” the squire continues, “but they won’t turn down armed company either. It is the safest route if you mean to answer Sir Obasi’s summons.”
> 
> The knight finally speaks, voice calm and measured.
> 
> “Be there before sunrise. The caravan master does not linger for stragglers.”
