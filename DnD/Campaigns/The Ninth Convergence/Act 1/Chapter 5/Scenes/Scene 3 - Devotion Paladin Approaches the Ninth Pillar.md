“I must thank you for bringing him. His mind was weak… but his conviction is strong.”

> He steps away from his pillar.
> 
> The air grows colder.
> 
> The hum lowers in tone.

“He will serve us well.”

He begins walking toward the ninth pillar.

Each step deliberate.

Measured.

No resistance from the circle.

## 🧠 What the Party Can Notice

### Arcana / Religion DC 15

The ritual should have collapsed when he broke contact.

It did not.

That means the power source has shifted.

### Perception DC 14

The light is no longer flowing evenly.

It is feeding inward.

Toward the ninth pillar.

### Insight DC 16

He is not performing devotion.

He is harvesting.

## 🎭 His Philosophy

Let this land slowly.

> “Oaths are curious things.”
> 
> “They bind the weak… and elevate the faithful.”
> 
> “They promise strength. Clarity. Purpose.”
> 
> He stands tall against the ninth pillar.
> 
> “But what is an oath… without the will to wield it?”

The novices’ eyes are closed.

They continue chanting softly.

But now the chant is slightly out of sync.

Like echoes misaligned.

## The Ninth Pillar

Describe it differently now.

The runes no longer glow silver.

They are beginning to glow pale blue.

Veins of darker energy crawl beneath the stone.

Like cracks under ice.

---

> He stops before the ninth pillar.
> 
> He does not touch it.
> 
> Not yet.
> 
> “Conviction is powerful.”

Pause.

Let someone speak if they want.

If they interrupt, he does not react with anger.

He simply finishes.

---

> Slowly…
> 
> He places his gauntlet upon the ninth pillar.

## ⚡ Immediate Effect

The hum stops.

Silence.

Total.

Then—

There is a calm around the eight pillars.

The light dims.

Silver threads break inward into the ninth pillar.
