**1. Who are you?**

- “I am one who serves the Oath of Devotion. I am here to guide the faithful and ensure the ritual strengthens all who honour their oaths.”
    
- Tone: Calm, reverent, non-threatening.
    

**2. What is this ritual for?**

- “This ritual renews the bonds of the oaths. It reaffirms the light in all who stand before the pillars. By placing your hands and speaking the words of your oath, you join in its blessing.”
    

**3. Where should we stand / what should we do?**

- “You should stand outside the circle, your companion should kneel at the Vengeance pillar. Once he places his hand and speaks his oath, the ritual will continue. I will oversee the process and guide all who participate.”
    

**4. Why are the other pillars occupied?**

- “The novices at these pillars are speaking their oaths now, deep in prayer. They are absorbed in the ritual; they will not be disturbed. Their presence ensures the strength of the ceremony.”
    

**5. What is the ninth pillar?**

- “The ninth pillar receives the combined devotion of all who participate. It completes the circle and channels the energy of the oaths into a single, sacred source.”
    

**6. What if someone doesn’t know their oath?**

- “Then I will guide them. Speak your words clearly, place your hand on the pillar, and the ritual will accept your devotion. The oaths bind those who act in faith.”
    

**7. Can we intervene if a paladin is struggling?**

- “No, do not disrupt the flow. Faith must come willingly. The ritual cannot be forced.”
    

**8. Can we interact with the novices?**

- “They are in deep prayer. Disturbing them would interrupt the blessing. Observe, but do not speak.”
    

**9. Why is my companion needed at Vengeance?**

- “The ritual requires the full circle. Every pillar must be attended. Your companion is part of this sacred balance. Without him, the ceremony cannot complete its purpose.”
    

**10. What happens when all the oaths are spoken?**

- “The energy will flow into the ninth pillar, reinforcing the power of the oaths. Only when every participant has fulfilled their part will the ritual conclude.”
