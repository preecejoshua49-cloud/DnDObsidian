## 🎭 - Read Aloud

The tavern air is thick with tension. Tankards clink. Low murmurs drift between tables.
A chair scrapes against the wooden floor as a mercenary rises and approaches your table.
He looks each of you over carefully.
“I’ve had enough of you lot,” he growls. “Either you leave… or we’ll make you leave.”
Around him, his companions stand. Patrons quietly move out of the way.

Pause for player response.
