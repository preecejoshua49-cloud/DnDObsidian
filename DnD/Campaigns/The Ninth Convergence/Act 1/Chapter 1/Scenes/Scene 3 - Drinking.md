## 🥂 First Drink – Polite & Professional

She approaches with an easy smile, wiping her hands on her apron.

“Evenin’, loves. What’ll it be? Ale’s fresh, mead’s strong, and if you’re feeling brave, we’ve got something the regulars call ‘Grave Dust.’”

She waits patiently.

 “One round at a time, mind. I like to remember who falls over first.”

## 🍺 Second Drink – Friendly Banter

She returns with a raised brow.

“Another round? Either you’re thirsty… or avoiding someone.”

A smirk.

 “Careful now. This one’s stronger than the first. I’d hate to see heroes bested by barley.”

She sets the drink down with a deliberate clink.

## 🍻 Third Drink – Playful Warning

She leans slightly on the table now.

“Ahhh. We’re building momentum.”

She eyes the most talkative party member.

“You’re slurring. Just a little. It’s charming. For now.”

A small pause.

“Same again?”


## 🍷 Fourth Drink – Subtle Concern

Her smile tightens — just slightly.

“You’re keeping pace with the dockworkers. That’s rarely a good sign.”

She glances around the tavern.

“I’ll bring it… but you might want to slow the world before it starts spinning you.”

The mug lands heavier this time.

## 🥴 Fifth Drink – Direct Warning

She doesn’t smile this time.

“This is where pride takes over.”

She sets the mug down but keeps her hand on it for a second.

“After this… you won’t get to decide if you’re done.”

She releases the drink.

“Last chance to be sensible.”

## 💀 Sixth Drink – Automatic Wasted

She stares at them for a long moment.
Then shrugs.

“Well. You asked.”

She sets the drink down.

“When you wake up , don’t say I didn’t warn you.”

You finish your drinks.
The world tilts. Words tangle. Balance deserts you.
You are well and truly drunk.
