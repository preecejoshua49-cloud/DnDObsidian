## ⚔ Combat Adjustments (Important for Balance)

Choose ONE of these:
- Reduce mercenary HP by 2–3 each
- Make one mercenary drunk and reckless
- Have mercenaries flee at half HP
- Guards arrive after 3 rounds

This prevents accidental TPK at Level 1.

## 🎲 Optional Drunken Chaos (Light Touch Only)

At the start of each drunk PC’s turn, roll 1d6:

1. You stumble and fall prone.
2. Overcommit — first attack has advantage, but attacks against you have advantage until next turn.
3. You loudly insult someone irrelevant.
4. You mistake a table for cover (no effect).
5. Sudden clarity — ignore drunk penalties this turn.
6. Liquid courage — gain 2 temp HP.

Use sparingly — once per round total is usually enough.

## 🧾 Aftermath (Drunk Version)

### If They Win

## 🎭 - Read Aloud

You’re fairly certain you stood on a table at some point.
The innkeeper looks exhausted.
“Pay for the damage. Now.”

### If They Lose

## 🎭 - Read Aloud

The world spins.
You wake up in the dirt outside the tavern.
Your head pounds.
Your coin purse feels lighter.
