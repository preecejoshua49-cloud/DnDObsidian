## If the Party Demands an Explanation

**Party:** “What have you done?”

**Calder:**

“I have removed the lie.”

He gestures toward the shattered oath symbols.

“They were taught that power comes from obedience.”

“It does not.”

“They ration it.”

A pause.

“Good.”

“Glory fades.”

He steps forward slowly.

“But power…”

A subtle pulse from the fractured halo behind him.

“…remains.”

# Subtle Escalation During Dialogue

While they speak:

- The cracked floor widens.
    
- Black radiance slowly gathers around his boots.
    
- The broken rune rotates behind him, slow and deliberate.
    
- The air grows heavier.
    

If they push too long, the environment answers before he does.
