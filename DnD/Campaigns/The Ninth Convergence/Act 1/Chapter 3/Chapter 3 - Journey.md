## Overview 
**Chapter Number:** 3
**Chapter Title:** Journey
**Chapter Opening:** 
Morning mist clings low to the ground as the party approaches the eastern gate. The city is quieter here — fewer vendors, more wagons, draft horses stamping against the chill.
Three caravans are gathered, but only one bears the faint symbol of the Temple of the Eight etched onto its lead wagon — not holy iconography, just a practical marking of destination.
At its centre stands the caravan master.
A broad-shouldered woman with weather-lined skin and iron-grey hair tied back in a severe braid, studies the party.
