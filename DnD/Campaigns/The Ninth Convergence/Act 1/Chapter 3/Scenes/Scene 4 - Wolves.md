### 🎭 Read Aloud

> The caravan winds along a narrow forest path.  
> The sun dips toward the horizon, casting long shadows across wheels and horses’ hooves.
> 
> A subtle tension hangs in the air. The novices at the rear seem unaware, chatting quietly or lost in thought.  
> But the horses… they are different. Ears flick. Nostrils flare. Hooves shift nervously.  
> One snorts, tugging sharply at its reins. Another paws at the dirt, anxious.
> 
> The caravan master frowns, scanning the trees.
> 
> “Something’s not right,” he mutters.

Pause for player observation, perception, or investigation.

## 🎲 Player Investigation

### Success

- DC 12–15 Perception (or Investigation) to notice movement in the treeline.
    
- Drunk or exhausted characters: roll at disadvantage.

### 🎭 Read-Aloud (Successful Detection)

> From the shadows of the trees, lean forms step into view, circling the path.  
> Eyes glint faintly in the fading light.  
> Horses tense further, but with a sharp word or steadying hand, you prepare the caravan.
> 
> The first wolf waits, teeth bared — but you are ready.

- No surprise round.
- Players may ready actions, position themselves, or warn the caravan.


### ❌ Failure / No Investigation

- The wolves strike before the party reacts.
- Horses panic — wagons jerk, crates shift, hooves pound.

### 🎭 Read-Aloud (Surprise)

> Suddenly, shapes leap onto the road. Wolves — three, maybe more — teeth bared and eyes wild.  
> Horses scream. Hooves strike the earth.  
> You have only a moment to react as the first wolf attacks.

- Wolves get a surprise round.
    
- Horses may continue panicking during the first round, creating environmental hazards:
    
    - Crates can topple (Dex save DC 12 to avoid damage)
        
    - Wagons shift (difficult terrain for the first round)
