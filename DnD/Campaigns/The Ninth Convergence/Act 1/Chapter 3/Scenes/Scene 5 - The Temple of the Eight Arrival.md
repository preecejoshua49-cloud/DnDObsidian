The forest thins as the caravan crests a gentle ridge.  
Beyond the trees, the **Temple of the Eight** rises in full view
An impressive structure of pale stone, perfectly symmetrical. Its spires reach skyward like fingers of devotion, catching the late afternoon sun. The massive doors stand open, welcoming travelers.
Bright banners, each representing one of the eight oaths, ripple gently in the breeze.  
The courtyard is tidy, immaculate — no signs of fire, chaos, or neglect.
Horses step carefully down the slope, nostrils flaring at new scents: stone, incense, and something faintly metallic in the air.  
The novices glance toward the temple with quiet awe, silence holding them in check.

Pause to let the players take in the sight.

The caravan master guides the wagons steadily toward the entrance.
“We’re here. Keep your heads, follow the path, and watch the horses. Respect the place — this is holy ground.”
