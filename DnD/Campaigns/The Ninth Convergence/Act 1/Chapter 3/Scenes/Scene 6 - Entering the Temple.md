## 🎭 Entering the Temple

> As you walk through the gates, the polished stone echoes faintly beneath your boots.  
> In the central chamber, eight figures stand together, deep in conversation.  
> Their robes and stances are formal, deliberate.  
> They do not yet notice you — their attention is elsewhere.
