**To those named herein,**

I would not summon you without cause, nor would I lend my seal to rumour or unease born of imagination.
There are disturbances among the Oaths. Subtle at first — hesitations in judgment, zeal without clarity. I have witnessed brothers and sisters falter where once they stood unshaken.

I lack proof, but I do not lack instinct. And my instinct tells me this fracture will widen if left unattended. I require allies who will not bend easily, and whose counsel I trust beyond the echo of temple walls.

**Bard**, you have always known how to draw truth from pride and music from discord. Your voice may be needed where steel cannot reach.

**Druid**, you sense imbalance before others even perceive it. If the roots of our order are tainted, I trust you to feel where the corruption lies.

**Dwarf**, your loyalty has never wavered, even when tested. In uncertain times, steadfast hearts matter most.

**Gnome**, I will speak plainly — I do not yet know where you stand. If you answer this call, you will have the opportunity to make that clear.

**Goliath**, I ask for restraint as much as strength. What approaches may demand patience before fury. I trust you can master both.

Travel to [[Fellmere]] and meet me at the Temple of the Eight at The High Fell. I ask that you arrive by the seventh dawn.

May your steps be guided by the weight of your word.

P.S. The squire carries fifty gold pieces for each of you — use them wisely, whether for gear, provisions, or a small indulgence. Consider it a token of my trust and my thanks for standing at my side.  
And yes — here is coin enough for me as well. Surprise me.

**In oath and in honour,**  
**Obasi, Sworn of Vengeance**
