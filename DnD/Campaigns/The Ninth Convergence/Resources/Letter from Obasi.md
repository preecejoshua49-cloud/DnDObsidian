**To those named herein,**

I would not summon you without cause, nor would I lend my seal to rumour or unease born of imagination. What I write now comes from observation, prayer, and a growing certainty that something is amiss.

There are disturbances among the Oaths. Subtle at first — hesitations in judgment, zeal without clarity. I have witnessed brothers and sisters falter where once they stood unshaken.

I lack proof, but I do not lack instinct. And my instinct tells me this fracture will widen if left unattended. I require allies who will not bend easily, and whose counsel I trust beyond the echo of temple walls.

Bard, you have always known how to draw truth from pride and music from discord. Your voice may be needed where steel cannot reach.

Druid, you sense imbalance before others even perceive it. If the roots of our order are tainted, I trust you to feel where the corruption lies.

Dwarf, your loyalty has never wavered, even when tested. In uncertain times, steadfast hearts matter most.

Gnome, I will speak plainly — I do not yet know where you stand. If you answer this call, you will have the opportunity to make that clear.

Goliath, I ask for restraint as much as strength. What approaches may demand patience before fury. I trust you can master both.

Meet me at the Temple of the Eight within three days’ time. Come prepared, but come with open eyes. I would rather be proven overly cautious than fatally complacent.

May your steps be guided by the weight of your word.

P.S the squire carries 50 gold pieces for each of you—use them wisely, whether for gear, provisions, or a small indulgence. Consider it a token of my trust and my thanks for standing at my side.
Oh, and here's X amount for me too - get me something nice.

**In oath and in honour,**  
**Obasi, Sworn of Vengeance**
