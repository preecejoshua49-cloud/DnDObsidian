| Survival           | 12  | All you can see is some sort of animal tracks leading up tot he corpse | You see bear tracks, it appears the bear approached, stood up right and then left walking on two legs.                                      | On 15+ the trackle circle the body in a spiral before leaving          |
| Nature             | 12  | You can make out this isn't feeding behaviour but not much else        | You notice this isn't typical feeding behaviour, the cut appears to clean for claws and the sap inside seems to be infused with plant magic | On 15+ The sap smells faintly like the spores from the underground     |
| Medicine           | 11  | You notice the Elk is dead                                             | You determine that the Elk died instantly from a single massive blow, and something deliberately opened it post-mortem.                     | on 14+ The rib cage was positioned intentionally - not random tearing. |
