**Opening Description:** A deep crack splits the ceiling, and roots burst through the stone like spears. The treasure room convulses — gold scatters, fungus ruptures, and thick green vines lash outward with violent purpose.

They don’t grab.

They shove.

The vines coil around your waists, your arms, your weapons — not restraining, but driving. The floor fractures beneath you as a surge of roots erupts upward, lifting you in a choking wave of earth and splintered stone.

You are carried — forced — expelled.

Light explodes across your vision.

With a final heave, the forest spits you out onto hard ground.

You tumble through broken grass and shattered stone, coughing spores into open air.

Silence.

You lie beneath a grey summer sky. The druid circle behind you is cracked and half-swallowed by sudden overgrowth. The trees stand taller than before. Thicker. Closer.

The air is heavy. Watching.

And somewhere deeper in the woods…

Something large moves.

## Challenge 

The trees thin into a small clearing — and the smell hits you first.

A massive elk lies at its centre, perfectly still. Its body has been split cleanly from throat to tail, the rib cage pulled open and folded back like great wooden doors. There are no bite marks. No torn flesh. No sign of feeding.

Where blood should pool, thick amber sap glistens in the cavity, catching the light like resin in a lantern.

Around the corpse, half-sunken in the grass, five small stones sit in a loose spiral — as if the body is the centre of something carefully arranged.
