**Scene Type**: Transition

**Setting**: Underground

**Encounter Type**: Exploration, Puzzle

**Opening Description:** A yawning chasm stretches before you, darkness swallowing the bottom. Its walls are slick stone, the drop seeming endless. There is **no visible path across**, no ledges, no rope — only the echo of your own breathing and the distant drip of water.

Then you notice something strange: faint **bioluminescent spores drift lazily in the air**, hovering near the edge of the cliff. The air smells damp and earthy, and the spores seem… **expectant**.

~~Tentatively, one of you steps forward. As your foot presses into the void, a **tremor of life shivers along the darkness below**, and a thin strand of **glowing mycelium sprouts from the chasm**, forming a fragile foothold.~~

~~With careful faith, each step begins to **grow more strands**, forming a **pulsing, living lattice of fungus**. The bridge responds to your courage and hesitation alike — the more trust and coordination you show, the more stable the path becomes.~~

~~The mycelium bridge is **alive**, uncertain, and watching. Every step feels like a negotiation: **will you trust it… and yourselves… enough to cross?**~~

Characters can speak words of courage or guide each other, giving temporary +1 on all checks until the next section.

## Challenge 

- **Step Growth**
    - Each character that steps on a new segment causes it to **expand slightly**, creating new footholds.
    - **Effect:** The bridge grows in length or width, but this growth can be unpredictable — some sections may be thinner than expected.
    
- **Weight / Collapse Risk**
    - If **two or more medium+ creatures step on the same segment at once**, the DM rolls **d10**:
        - 1–3: Segment collapses under weight.
        - 4–10: Segment holds.
    - Collapse → characters must succeed on **DC 12 Dexterity save** or fall into the chasm (or catch themselves on lower layers if you want partial safety).

**Fire / Heat Hazard**

- Any open flame or fire spell on the mycelium lattice causes a **violent spore eruption**.
    - Roll **d6 per creature nearby**: 1–3 inhale spores → **DC 12 Constitution save or become poisoned for 1 minute**.
    - 4–6: harmless burst, minor visibility hindrance.
