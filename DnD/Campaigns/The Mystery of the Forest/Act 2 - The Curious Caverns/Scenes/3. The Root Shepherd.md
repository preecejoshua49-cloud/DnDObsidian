## Overview 

**Scene Type**: Encounter

**Setting**: Underground

**Encounter Type**: Combat, Investigative

**Opening Description:** The torchlight flickers against damp stone as you step deeper into the cavern. The air is thick with moisture and the faint, earthy scent of roots and moss. Somewhere, water drips steadily, echoing in the silence.

Ahead, the wall bulges unnaturally. Twisting, gnarled roots crawl across the stone, and from the center of the wall, a **humanoid form is fused into the roots and bark**, half-alive, half-wood. Amber sap glows faintly where its eyes should be, pulsing with a slow rhythm like a heartbeat.

It tilts its head, voice low and resonant, carrying easily across the cavern:

> “You are early.”

The roots around it shift slightly, brushing the cavern floor. Every tendril seems aware of your presence. The cavern feels alive, the very walls watching.
