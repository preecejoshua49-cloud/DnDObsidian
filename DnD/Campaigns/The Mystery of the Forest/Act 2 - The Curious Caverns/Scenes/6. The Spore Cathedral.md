## Overview 

**Scene Type**: Transition

**Setting**: Underground

**Encounter Type**: Subterfuge

**Opening Description:** You step into a cavern unlike any other. The ceiling stretches high above, dripping with moisture, yet the chamber is **alive with a soft, golden glow**. Bioluminescent mushrooms of every size carpet the floor, their caps like lanterns in a forest of fungus.

At the center of the cathedral, carved into the stone floor, is a **perfect circle** inscribed with letters that pulse faintly:

> “The Skin Is a Prison.”

As you approach, the spores that drift lazily through the air seem to **thicken**, dancing on currents stirred by your movement.

## Challenge 

### **Mechanics**

**Core Mechanic:** Narrative knockout with escalating saving throws.

- **Initial Save:** DC 12 Constitution
- **Escalation:** +2 DC for each subsequent wave (DC 12 → 14 → 16…)
- **Fail:** Roll result compared to DC
    - Fail by 0–4: dizziness, minor nausea, blurred vision
    - Fail by 5+: hallucinations (flavor-driven, lasts 1–3 minutes narrative time)
    - Fail 3 total times: **unconscious**
    - When failing by 10+: **unconscious**

**Even Success?**

- The spores **fill the entire chamber regardless**, making standing or moving difficult.

### **Hallucination / Flavor Suggestions**

When failing by 5+:

- **Visual distortions:** walls ripple like water, mushrooms pulse like giant eyes, shadows twist unnaturally.
- **Auditory illusions:** whispering voices, echoing footsteps, or the sound of wings flapping inside the cavern.
- **Emotional manipulations:** feelings of dread, euphoria, or nostalgia; seeing impossible versions of companions.

## Additional Details 

The moment you disturb the circle, **golden spores explode into the air**, thickening instantly. You choke and cough, vision blurring as dizziness overtakes you. Some of you see walls ripple, hear whispers, or feel your own heartbeat echo in impossible rhythm.

Despite your efforts, the spores fill the cavern. One by one, your strength fails, and you collapse into the soft fungal floor.

And then… from somewhere deep within the cavern, **cheering rings out**, hollow and strange, as though the forest itself has been watching.
