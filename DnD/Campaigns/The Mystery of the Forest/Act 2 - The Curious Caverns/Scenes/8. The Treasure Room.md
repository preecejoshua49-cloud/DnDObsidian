## Overview 

**Scene Type**: Conclusion

**Setting**: Underground

**Encounter Type**: Subterfuge

**Opening Description:** The last enemy falls, and their body **flickers and vanishes** in a shimmer of golden light. One by one, you feel the same strange tug, as if the arena itself lifts you—then you blink.

You are no longer in the arena. You lie—or stand—on smooth stone in a **vaulted chamber softly lit by glowing runes**. Magic hums faintly in the air, brushing against your skin.

Near the center, **one of you still lies unconscious**, the room’s gentle pulse seeming to coax them awake. Next to each hero rests a **single chest**, modest but clearly enchanted, as if waiting for its rightful owner.

A quiet, resonant voice fills the space:

> “Those who endure are deemed worthy. Flesh may fall, but spirit survives. Here, your reward awaits.”

The arena was never a trap to destroy—it was a crucible. Only the worthy are brought here, and only together can you claim what lies within.
