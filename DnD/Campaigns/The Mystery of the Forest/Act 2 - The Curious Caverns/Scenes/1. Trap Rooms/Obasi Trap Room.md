## Overview 

**Scene Type**: Encounter

**Setting**: Extradimensional

**Encounter Type**: Puzzle

**Opening Description:** “You enter a small shrine overtaken by fungus and rot. Bones lie half-consumed in the damp earth. In the center, a holy symbol is embedded in bark and decay, and three swollen growths pulse slowly — like a sick, patient heart.”

## Participants 

[[Obasi]]

## The Holy Symbol Reaction

When a divine character approaches:

- The holy symbol embedded in bark faintly warms.
- Not when they pray.
- Not when they cast.
- Only when they physically reach toward the decay.

No roll needed — just describe it.

## Challenge 

### Reading the Carving

**Religion DC 12**

Understand: “Decay feeds life. Deny one, all suffer.”

**Perception DC 11**

Notice one corpse’s hand is intentionally embedded.

**Medicine DC 11**

Determine the person died from something else — not the fungus.

### Correct Solution

They must willingly touch the rot.

Take **1d6 necrotic damage**.

Then:

**Con Save DC 11**

Success:

- Shrine glows briefly.
- Exit opens.

Fail:

- Take additional **1d4 necrotic**
- Still succeed — this is about sacrifice.

### If They Burn or Attack It

Spores erupt.

**Con Save DC 12**

Fail:

- Poisoned for 1 minute (can repeat save at end of turn)

Exit only opens after someone accepts decay.

## Rewards 

Once before next long rest, they can reduce damage taken by 1d6 as bark briefly hardens over their skin.
