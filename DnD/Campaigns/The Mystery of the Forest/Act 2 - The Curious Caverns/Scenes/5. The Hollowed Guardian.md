## Overview 

**Scene Type**: Encounter

**Setting**: Underground

**Encounter Type**: Combat

**Opening Description:** The cavern narrows suddenly, walls slick with moisture and streaked with faint phosphorescent fungus. Water drips rhythmically from the ceiling, echoing through the dark.

Ahead, the massive **bear-shaped silhouette** looms against the cavern wall. At first, it seems like a **shadow cast by the jagged stone**, but as you approach, you see it is **real — a hollow carcass fused with twisting vines and moss, crawling along its frame like armor**.

Every movement of the cavern — a drip, a shift of rock, a small puff of spores — seems to **coincide with subtle twitching of its vine-covered limbs**. It is massive, still, and unnervingly silent.

Then a soft **creaking groan echoes** as the Guardian shifts slightly. The low sound **reverberates against the cavern walls**, making the air itself feel heavy.

## Additional Details 

“The vine-armored bear shifts with an unnatural weight, echoing against the cavern walls. When it collapses, the outer vines tear apart, revealing not flesh but an intricate lattice of glowing roots, reaching slowly toward you. Somewhere deeper, in the shadows of the cavern, you sense a patient, watchful presence — your unseen observer, waiting.”

- At **0 HP**, the Guardian splits open.
- Inside: **woven, pulsating roots**, faintly glowing in the cavern gloom.
- No meat remains — only **living lattice**, hinting at intelligence.

**Foreshadowing / Atmosphere:**

- The roots **pulse in rhythm with the cavern**, suggesting the **Root Shepherd or forest magic is aware**.
- The party senses a **watcher in the shadows**, echoing their earlier glimpses and tying into Bernard’s arc.
