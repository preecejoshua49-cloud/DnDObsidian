While holding this Shield, you have a bonus to [Armor Class](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ArmorClass) determined by the Shield’s rarity, in addition to the Shield’s normal bonus to AC.

Shields require the [Utilize](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UtilizeAction) action to Don or Doff. You gain the Armor Class benefit of a Shield only if you have training with it.

Notes: Bonus: Armor Class, Combat, Warding
