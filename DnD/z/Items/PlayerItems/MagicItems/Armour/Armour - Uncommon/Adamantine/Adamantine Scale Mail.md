## Armor (scale mail), uncommon

This suit of armor is reinforced with adamantine, one of the hardest substances in existence. While you’re wearing it, any [Critical Hit](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CriticalHit) against you becomes a normal hit.

This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.
