- **Usage in Gameplay:** Necromancers or characters using _Vampiric Touch_ might use small animal hearts (e.g., rats, lizards, or birds) to trigger healing features like the wizard's Grim Harvest.
- **Alternatives:** If not using a specific, magical heart, a small heart is treated as a component for mundane alchemy or magical research.
