A Range weapon has a range in parentheses after the [Ammunition](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Ammunition) or [Thrown](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Thrown) property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second is the weapon’s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have [Disadvantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the long range.
