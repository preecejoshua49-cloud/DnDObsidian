If they connect ritual cycle logic from checks:

Correct order:  
**Eye → Fang → Leaf → Flame → Seed**

You can allow:

- Or let them reason it out via discussion

# 🟢 On Correct Order

- The sap inside the elk briefly glows.
    
- The spiral stones rotate slightly into alignment.
    
- A faint green trail of spores drifts deeper into the forest.
    
- Survival DC 10 now easily tracks Bernard.

They are now “in sync” with the hunt.

# 🔴 On Incorrect Order

- The elk convulses.
    
- Sap splashes outward.
    
- 2 Vine Blights emerge from beneath carcass.
    

Combat begins.

After combat, stones remain usable.
