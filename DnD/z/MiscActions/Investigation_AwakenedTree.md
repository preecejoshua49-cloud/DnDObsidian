### **Dialogue / Clues**

- **Forest:**
    - “The forest grows beyond its will. Some call it chaos, I call it preparation.”
- **Bernard the Bear:**
    - “He drifts between what he was and what he desires to be… he seeks a form, but not all forms are free of consequence.”
- **The Trap:**
    - “The circle catches the unwary. It is not punishment, only measurement. You are… earlier than expected.”

### **Checks / Player Interactions**

- **Insight / Arcana / Nature / History:**
    - DC 12–15 checks could reveal:
        - The Shepherd is **half-fused with the tree** — magical influence ongoing.
        - The forest’s accelerated growth is **unnatural and partially druidic**.

### **Optional Twist**

- If the party presses too hard, the Shepherd may **withdraw partially into the tree** or **send a root tendril to restrain or prod them**, but without full attack — a warning rather than combat.
