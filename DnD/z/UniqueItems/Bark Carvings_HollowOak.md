## Investigation – DC 10

Carved by the same hand.

## Survival – DC 12

Carved over weeks or months.

Not all at once.

## Insight – DC 13

These aren’t threats.

They’re reminders.

This is someone fighting something internal.

**If a PC presses their palm to the carved phrase:**

WIS save DC 12.

On success:

They feel:

- Desperation.
- Frustration.
- Loneliness.
- A mind trapped in something larger.

On failure:

Brief surge of primal instinct.

No harm.

Just emotional echo.
