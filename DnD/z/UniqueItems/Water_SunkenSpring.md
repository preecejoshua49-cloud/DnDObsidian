## If a PC touches the water

It ripples outward… then inward.

This is unnatural.

No check required to notice that.

It feels… empowering.

# 🩸 If Blood Enters the Water

Accidentally or intentionally.

The water darkens slightly.

Ripples move against gravity.

Arcana DC 12:

This reacted to life force.

Arcana DC 16:

It absorbed it.

Somewhere in the forest:

A low exhale.

No immediate consequence.

But you mentally mark:

+1 Ritual Charge.

# ✨ Detect Magic

Strong Transmutation aura.

Faint secondary aura beneath it:

Something older.

Almost druidic.

If they focus longer:

The magic pulses like a heartbeat.

# 🪞 The Reflection

When someone looks into the water:

Have them describe what they see.

Then add:

For just a split second — the reflection shifts.

- Broader.
- Furred.
- Larger.
- Eyes not quite their own.

No roll.

Just narrative.

If they blink?

It’s gone.

#  Disrupting the Water

Breaking carvings: Roots tighten in surrounding earth.

Arcana DC 14: Disrupting this could release something unstable.

If they persist: Minor root lash (non-lethal warning)

Don’t punish. Warn.
